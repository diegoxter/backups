V<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Scholl">Sophie Scholl</a> (1921-1943) was a German activist who is famous for speaking out against the Nazi regime. Scholl was a member of a protest group called The White Rose, which was formed by her brother Hans, and some of his university friends. The group mainly consisted of students in their early twenties who were fed up with the totalitarian rule of the government. The Nazis controlled every aspect of society &#8211; the media, police, military, judiciary system, communication system, all levels of education and all cultural and religious institutions. The White Rose distributed leaflets urging their fellow Germans to oppose the regime through non-violent resistance.</p>\u000a<p>On 22nd February 1943, after the release of the sixth White Rose leaflet, Sophie, Hans and fellow member Christoph Probst were arrested by the Gestapo and convicted of treason. They were executed that same day by guillotine. Sophie was 21 years old.</p>\u000a<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The source of this quote has been disputed. It&#8217;s been sourced on <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Sophie_Scholl">Wikiquote</a>, but on further investigation by some readers, it can&#8217;t be 100\u005c% confirmed. It could have originated from a 1991 play about Scholl written by Lillian Garrett-Groag.</p>\u000a<p class="notes">- Thanks to Elise for submitting this quote.<br />\u000a- <em>Sophie Scholl: The Final Days</em> is a 2005 German movie that depicts Scholl&#8217;s last days and trial. It was nominated for best foreign film at the Oscars. I found the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmcSkrhWJRQ">entire film on YouTube</a>, although I&#8217;m not sure how long it will remain up.<br />\u000a- In case you missed it last week, <a href="http://zenpencils.com/blog/the-zen-pencils-short-film/">someone made a short film</a> based on one of my comics.</p>

I was squealing like a school girl while watching it. The film was made by Sahel Takal, a recently graduated Film and TV student from Anglia Ruskin University (Cambridge UK) and he is entering it in the 2013 London Sundance Film Festival short film competition. Sahel asked my permission to adapt the comic at the start of January and I completely forgot about it &#8211; it was such a pleasant surprise to actually see the finished product.</p>\u000a<p><img alt="aroundthecorner" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1727" height="558" src="http://maxcdn.zenpencils.com/wp-content/uploads/aroundthecorner.jpg?9d7bd4" width="580" /> </p>\u000a<p>From Sahel:</p>\u000a<p><em>&#8220;The main theme of the competition was time, when I saw this comic I immediately fell in love with the simplicity of it. I could not help but to visualise all the images in my head. It showed time in different ways: as a kid you have all the time in the world to hang around with your friends, but as adults you have almost no time, because of work and family. This inspired me a lot and I really wanted to adapt this into a film. I wanted to bring the still images to life and tell the story through a different art form. When I got the permission from you to adapt the comic into a film, I started working on it as soon as possible. I was really blessed with the crew members and everyone else who helped. I am very happy with the end result and I hope everyone else enjoys it as much as they enjoyed the original comic.&#8221;</em></p>\u000a<p>This is such a thrill for me. I&#8217;ve often imagined what some of my comics would look like as a film and now I actually get the chance to see one &#8211; it&#8217;s like a dream come true. A huge thank you to Sahel and I wish him the best of luck in the competition.</p>

V<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hadfield">Chris Hadfield</a> (August 1959-) is a Canadian astronaut currently on assignment aboard the International Space Station. He will become the first Canadian Commander of the ISS when Expedition 35 takes over this March.</p>\u000a<p>Hadfield has become an Internet-celebrity, using social media and YouTube to share what daily life is like aboard the ISS. He regularly <a href="https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield">tweets</a> breath-taking photos of Earth (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/02/26/chris-hadfield-photos-from-space_n_2768497.html#slide=2157665">here is a selection of his best pics</a>) and has a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/canadianspaceagency">YouTube channel</a> with videos on everything from how he operates a giant robotic arm to how he eats a peanut butter and honey pita sandwich (bread isn&#8217;t used because of the crumbs). This particular quote is taken from a recent <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkantrowitz/2013/02/18/five-highlights-from-commander-chris-hadfields-reddit-ama-from-space/">Redditt &#8216;Ask me anything&#8217;</a> session Hadfield took part in while aboard the ISS. A youngster asked if Hadfield had any advice for an aspiring astronaut, and this quote was his reply.</p>\u000a<p class="notes">- Thanks to Jason for submitting this.<br />\u000a- RELATED COMICS: <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/76-neil-armstrong-a-giant-among-men/">Neil Armstrong.</a> <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/33-edgar-mitchell-a-global-consciousness/">Edgar Mitchell.</a> <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/100-carl-sagan-pale-blue-dot/">Carl Sagan.</a> <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/64-robert-h-goddard-the-rocket-man/">Robert Goddard.</a> <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/52-phil-plait-welcome-to-science/">Phil Plait.</a> <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/42-neil-degrasse-tyson-the-most-astounding-fact/">Neil deGrasse Tyson.</a></p>\u000a<p class="print"><a href="http://society6.com/zenpencils/106-CHRIS-HADFIELD_Print">BUY THE PRINT</a></p>

By 1926 he had left the army and helped pioneer some of the first air-mail routes between Paris and Dakar. In 1935, while trying to break the speed record between Paris and Saigon, he crashed and was left stranded in the Sahara desert for three days with a minimum of supplies. Although the experience almost killed him, it became the inspiration for the opening scene in <em>The Little Prince</em>. Saint-Exupéry later flew reconnaissance missions during World War II even though he was eight years above the maximum age and, after leaving for a mission on 31 July, 1944, was never seen again. </p>\u000a<p class="notes">- Thanks to Nathanial, Adam and Jacob for submitting this.</p>

V<p>I&#8217;ve had an overwhelming response to yesterday&#8217;s post about getting your help in translating my comics. In less than 24 hours I&#8217;ve received nearly 500 emails! I was expecting to get like 20 or 30 emails, but 500? I&#8217;m incredibly touched and flattered by your response and generosity. From the bottom of my heart \u2026 THANK YOU! Can I kindly ask that you stop sending emails as I think I should have more than enough volunteers for now.</p>\u000a<p>Next is the task of sorting through all the emails and organising this project properly. For each language I&#8217;ll be picking about 10 people, dividing the comics up between them and sending them a handful of &#8216;blank&#8217; comics with the text removed. They will have to place the translated copy on themselves (I will provide some fonts) so some knowledge of layout software is required. I won&#8217;t be able to respond to each of your emails individually so If you don&#8217;t hear from me please don&#8217;t be offended, and thank you again for offering to help.</p>\u000a<p>The response from my readers continues to amaze me.<br />\u000a- Gav</p>

I can provide lo-res comics with the English words removed so it&#8217;s easy for you to just place the translated words on top. You can do whichever one you like and as many or as few as you like.

V<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malala_Yousafzai">Malala Yousafzai</a> (1997-) is a 15-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot in the head on the way home from school by the Taliban. Her only crime was criticising the Taliban&#8217;s strict rules against female education and standing up for her right to go to school.</p>\u000a<p>Inspired by her activist father, Malala was involved in social justice from a young age. She first gained prominence at age 11, when she wrote a blog for the BBC for 10 weeks (under a pseudonym) detailing her life under Taliban rule. The blog was extremely popular and her real identity was later revealed when her father nominated her for an International Peace Prize. From there she started appearing on television, speaking against the Taliban&#8217;s ruling that banned girls from attending school. Her international status grew even more when she was featured in a New York Times documentary (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F5yeW6XFZk">which you can watch here</a>). She continued to speak out against the Taliban and was nominated for the International Youth Peace Prize and won the inaugural Pakistan National Youth Peace Prize in 2011 (now named the National Malala Peace Prize).</p>\u000a<p>On the 9th October 2012, on her way home from school, Malala was shot in the head and neck by a masked gunman (two other children, Kainat Riaz and Shazia Ramzan, were also injured). The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that Malala was &#8220;the symbol of the infidels and obscenity&#8221;. Straight after the incident Malala was taken to Peshawar Military hospital for an initial operation where part of her skull was removed to allow room for the swelling of her brain and was later flown to the United Kingdom for further treatment. She would receive two further surgeries to insert a titanium plate in her skull and attach a cochlear device in her left ear to restore her hearing. Malala was released from hospital this month and is currently staying in her temporary home with her family in Birmingham and is expected to make a full recovery.</p>\u000a<p>Malala has recently been nominated for the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize, the youngest person in history to receive the honour, and I, along with the millions of people she has inspired, am hoping this remarkable young woman wins.</p>\u000a<p class="notes">- The <a href="http://vitalvoices.org/node/3326">Malala Fund</a> was established to educate girls throughout the world.<br />\u000a- The quotes in the comic were taken from her blog entries, the NYT documentary and <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/15/world/malala-profile">this interview</a> Malala did with CNN.<br />\u000a- I illustrated the events of the shooting after reading a few sources: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2216836/Malala-Yousafzai-Which-Malala-She-punished-The-horrific-moment-teenage-female-education-activist-critically-injured-Taliban-gunman-school-bus.html">Daily Mail</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/09/pakistan-girl-shot-activism-swat-taliban">The Guardian</a>, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/10/world/asia/pakistan-malala-one-month">CNN</a>, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-02-09/malala-discharged-from-uk-hospital/4509686">ABC Australia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malala_Yousafzai#Assassination_attempt">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

V<p>Each month I shine the spotlight on some of my awesome, brilliant and incomparable readers. You lot are the best fans a blogger could ask for. This month meet Sreeja, Alex and Zeina.<br />\u000a<span id="more-1506"></span></p>\u000a<p class="reader">Sreeja Nag</p>\u000a<p><img alt="feb_sreeja" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1511" height="331" src="http://maxcdn.zenpencils.com/wp-content/uploads/feb_sreeja.jpg?9d7bd4" width="250" /><strong>Where are you from?</strong><br />\u000aIndia. I was born and schooled in a small town called Pune on the west coast. I did my undergraduate degrees in an even tinier town in east India called Kharagpur, albeit home to the oldest Indian Institute of Technology, my alma mater. I moved to Boston in US to pursue graduate studies a little over three years ago. I love to travel &#8211; both in the US and in India, and try to visit a few new countries every year.</p>\u000a<p><strong>What do you do?</strong><br />\u000aI&#8217;m doing a PhD in Space Systems engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) \u2013 Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Until about half a year back, I was on a team for robotic mission operations on the International Space Station (ISS). We\u2019d design, program and test satellite navigation algorithms on real satellites inside the low risk environment of the ISS (here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl6lZbyLkzs">cool video</a> of an experiment). For about one and a half years, I led a robotics programming competition called Zero Robotics where we built a free online interface for high school students to program our satellites on the ISS. The astronauts would execute the best of the submitted programs. I got to interact with hundreds of kids and spread the love for math and space. For the last few months, I\u2019ve been designing shoebox sized satellites and their optical instruments to swarm in dozens and achieve science as a network in space.</p>\u000a<p><strong>What is it about space, science and engineering that made you dedicate your entire life to it?</strong><br />\u000aI\u2019ve always loved math and science. As a kid, I found these fields adherent to hard logic and very objective. It was very different from the otherwise subjective world where people consistently argued about what\u2019s \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d. Math and the physical sciences came very intuitively to me and kids like things that are easy and fascinating at the same time. As I grew up, I realized that science is very subjective too, like all other things. But by then, I was in love with the incremental, cite-your-sources-or-shut-up, scientific process to answer questions on everything from DNA to the universe.</p>\u000a<p>Why space sciences and engineering, specifically? Well, the celestial bodies have, since ancient civilisations, always intrigued man so much that the Divine and its dwelling have found their place among them. Looking at it rationally, let\u2019s take an example &#8230; we gaze, every night, at the light that stars released millions of years ago so we\u2019re essentially looking at each star from millions of years ago. So the night sky we see is actually a space so vastly separated in time that, put together, it is only a visual illusion. Scientists quantified this illusion as the Hubble Ultra Deep Field thanks to the Hubble Space Telescope. It is tiny nuggets like this that motivate me to find out more about these \u201creal\u201d illusions \u2013 what better way than build missions to fly into space?</p>\u000a<p><strong>What are your favourite Zen Pencils comics?</strong><br />\u000aThe first Zen Pencils comic I ever saw was the illustration of an <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/33-edgar-mitchell-a-global-consciousness/">Edgar Mitchell quote</a> on the vastness of space inspiring global consciousness. I related to it instantly, much like Carl Sagan\u2019s <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/100-carl-sagan-pale-blue-dot/">Pale Blue Dot</a>, and it still is among my top favorites. It\u2019s really hard to pick favorites among Zen Pencils without listing at least 20 but here are some that are at the top of my mind: <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/64-robert-h-goddard-the-rocket-man/">Robert Goddard</a> for being a complete visionary, <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/97-charles-bukowski-air-and-light-and-time-and-space/">Charles Bukowski</a> for reminding us that creativity needs no prerequisites, <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/60-robert-frost-the-road-not-taken/">Robert Frost</a> for showing us the infinite possibilities of roads not taken and <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/73-mark-twain-an-educational-journey/">Mark Twain</a> for repeating how absolutely important it is for everyone who can, to travel.</p>\u000a<p class="reader">ALEX JACKSON, 16</p>\u000a<p><img alt="feb_alex" class="alignleft  wp-image-1512" height="190" src="http://maxcdn.zenpencils.com/wp-content/uploads/feb_alex.jpg?9d7bd4" width="150" /><strong>Tell us a bit about yourself.</strong><br />\u000aI&#8217;m 16 years old and from Gateshead, UK. I&#8217;m a writer, and despite my age I&#8217;ve been writing for five years now. I&#8217;m still in school but I do volunteer for my local football team by writing for their programme. My first love is writing stories, from novels to short pieces, and around this time last year I hit a buffer. I guess it was just writer&#8217;s block but it really drained my creativity away, and as an introvert I didn&#8217;t really have much else to fall back on. The only thing I had was a rough draft of a novel, but editing it to a better standard seemed like a mammoth task. As a result I spent most of the Spring wallowing in self-pity, and I only managed to get my act together thanks to some help from a friend.</p>\u000a<p><strong>Did Zen Pencils also help with that?</strong><br />\u000aI&#8217;d started half-heartedly working on the editing, and then in June I saw your <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/the-dalai-lama-answers-a-question/">Dalai Lama comic</a> on one of the meme websites. Impressed, I followed the link at the bottom and read all the other comics. It was of massive reassurance to me to see all of these motivational quotes in one place, and I returned to the editing with some drive and confidence. Whenever things weren&#8217;t working I&#8217;d just look back at the comics and that gave me enough energy to push on, and in December 2012 I finally finished refining that troublesome novel. And judging by the short stories I&#8217;ve written since then I&#8217;d say I&#8217;ve got my creativity back as well!</p>\u000a<p>My favourite comics are <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/97-charles-bukowski-air-and-light-and-time-and-space/">Air and Light and Time and Space</a> because I share Bukowski&#8217;s sentiments exactly, and <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/50-neil-gaiman-make-good-art/">Make Good Art</a> which was the one that really struck me while I wasn&#8217;t going anywhere.</p>\u000a<p>The only other thing I can say is that I think Zen Pencils should be shown to every artist in the world, writer or painter or filmmaker or any other type I&#8217;ve missed, because if it inspired me to keep going when giving up seemed attractive, then hopefully it can do the same for others lacking faith in their work.</p>\u000a<p class="reader">Zeina, 15, from Cairo lived through the Eygptian revolution of 2011 and I was interested to hear more about her story.</p>\u000a<p><strong>For those readers who aren&#8217;t sure, what was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Egyptian_revolution">Egypt Revolution</a> in 2011 and why was it so important?</strong><br />\u000aThe Egyptian Revolution started on January 25th 2011, with the sole intention of removing former president Hosny Mubarak from rule. For the previous 30 years, he had a dictatorial regime thoughout Egypt, and corruption was apparent anywhere you went. The revolution was led by the young people (18-30ish) but soon enough, the rest of the country had joined along. Everyone had one demand: get Hosny Mubarak out of power. The revolution, although considered peaceful, did see a couple hundred deaths. Mubarak stepped down after 18 days.</p>\u000a<p><strong>What was the feeling among young people and fellow teenagers like yourself?</strong><br />\u000aIt was amazing. Everyone was helping out the country in any way possible. Many people I know were staying in Tahrir Square (the focal point of the protests) for days, and excitement was in the air all the time. Since the police &#8220;disappeared&#8221; during the revolution, it was up to the people to keep the country in check. Many older men who couldn&#8217;t go to Tahrir Square were standing on the streets directing traffic, or helping compounds become secure. There was a day where all the prisons around the suburbs of Cairo were opened. Hundreds of thousands of prisoners escaped, and since there were no police, the people had to make sure everything was okay. Most people in the suburbs live in walled compounds, so men and kids would take shifts with armed guns guarding all the entrances and walls. Safety was a very big issue, and everyone had arms or weapons that they could defend themselves with if anything occurred. Roads leading into places with many villas and houses, and even small alleyways in Egypt, were all blocked by people, who wouldn&#8217;t let anyone pass without checks to the car or the people themselves. Everyone was really involved.</p>\u000a<p><strong>Were you involved in the protests?</strong><br />\u000aI did go to Tahrir Square a couple times, but most of the time I was either at home relaying news to my father or sitting by the road blocks. We had two other families coming to stay with us, because where they lived was very unsafe. Since I was the oldest of the kids, I spent many days babysitting so our parents could go protest. Once, my dad and other men on our street caught eight prisoners trying to enter the house. Because of all the help, nearly every single prisoner that was released was caught and sent back to the prisons, all by the people. The compound in front of us caught a hundred on their own! That doesn&#8217;t mean the criminals hadn&#8217;t wrecked anything \u2013 many people we know had their homes robbed or burned down.</p>\u000a<p><strong>So now with continued reports of corruption and outrage at the new President <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morsi">Mohamed Morsi&#8217;s</a> rule, are the youth of Eygpt losing hope?</strong><br />\u000aThe country right now isn&#8217;t in its best state. Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood have turned into a worse enemy than Mubarak, and people who voted for him are now regretting their decision. Although more people are dying in protests right now, the youth aren&#8217;t losing hope. When one falls, a hundred more go to take their place. The country is fighting strong against him, which sadly leads to a terrible economy. More people are on the streets rather than working, so hardly any money is entering the country. That is the one thing that is making most people hesitate from taking to the streets as well. The country needs money. People need to work, but they have to protest as well. It&#8217;s a spiral that can only stop when Morsy obliges to the country&#8217;s demands. (You can find out more about the history of the Muslim Brotherhood in this informative <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/history/2013/01/egypt_s_muslim_brotherhood_an_illustrated_history.html">comic strip</a>.)</p>\u000a<p><em>Many thanks to Sreeja, Alex and Zeina.

V<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis">C.S. Lewis</a> (1898-1963) was an Irish author most famous for the <em>Chronicles of Narnia</em> series. He was also a noted poet, critic and served as professor of English Literature at Oxford for 29 years. An atheist as a young man, Lewis would later would find his faith and go on to become one of the most important Christian authors of the 20th Century. I loved the <em>Narnia</em> books as a child and it&#8217;s interesting to find out now that the plot and characters were inspired by the Bible. <a href="http://atheism.about.com/od/cslewisnarnia/a/chroniclenarnia.htm">Aslan was Jesus?</a> Cool. Maybe if they recited the <em>Narnia</em> books in Church I would have paid more attention.</p>\u000a<p>The full version of this quote, taken from Lewis&#8217;s book, <em>The Four Loves</em>, reads:</p>\u000a<p><em>&#8220;To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket \u2014 safe, dark, motionless, airless \u2014 it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. The only place outside of Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.&#8221;</em></p>\u000a<p class="notes">- The official C.S. Lewis <a href="http://cslewis.com/">website</a>.<br />\u000a- Thanks to Vanessa, Karen and Ethan for submitting this quote.</p>\u000a<p class="print"><a href="http://society6.com/zenpencils/103-TO-LOVE-IS-TO-BE-VULNERABLE">BUY THE PRINT</a></p>
